# Web Scraper backend

This backend is powered by Node.js, Express, Mongoose and Puppeteer.

## Follow the following steps to test on your local machine

## Get started (Step 1)---run just once:

In this directory on your terminal, run:

### `npm install`

This will generate the node_modules folder in this directory necessary for the backend to run smoothly.

## Frontend Installation (Step 2):

Navigate to the frontend directory, run:

### `cd frontend`

Inside the frontend directory, run: 

### `npm install`

Now all necessary node_modules files have been installed for the project to run on your local machine.

## Start Web Crawler Application (Step 3):

Go back to the main directory from the frontend, run:

### `cd ..`

In this project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will start the application and run the backend and frontend using concurrently
